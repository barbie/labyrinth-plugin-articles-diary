Labyrinth-Plugin-Articles-Diary
===============================

This distribution acts as a plugin to Labyrinth, a Website Management Framework.

The module within provides all the functionality to implement a simple blog
engine. Together with supplementary files stored within the /vhost directory,

INSTALLATION

See the INSTALL file for full instructions for how to install the modules.

ADDITIONAL FILES

Additional files are needed to enable Labyrinth and any installed plugins to 
work correctly. These files consist of SQL, HTML template and configuration 
files, together with some basic CSS and Javascript files.

However, these files are only the beginning, and to implement your website, 
you will need to update the appropriate files to use your own layout design.

ADDITION INFORMATION

Although Labyrinth has long been in development, documentation has not been a 
priority. As such much of the documentation you may need to understand how to 
use Labyrinth is the code itself. If you have the inclination, documentation 
patches would be very gratefully received.

The Labyrinth website [1] will eventually feature a documentation site, wiki 
and other features which are intended to provide you with the information to 
use and extend Labyrinth as you wish.
